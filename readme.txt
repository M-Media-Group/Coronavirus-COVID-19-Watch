== Description ==
 
This plugin will get live data with total cases around the world and show it on your dashboard. It will also add a helpful link in the top toolbar to quickly get more info. It will also add a widget that you can add to your footers or menus.

There's also a shortcode you can use in your posts to always reference the most up to date number of confirmed cases. Use the shortcode [covid-confirmed] in your code to output the current number of confirmed cases. You can pass a country and status, like [covid-confirmed country="France" status="confirmed"] or [covid-confirmed country="US" status="deaths"] to get results only from that country.
